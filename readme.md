# What's this for?
This repository contains [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) scripts that I've posted.

# Can I use them for my mods?
You don't have to ask. As long I'm ***credited*** for a scripts usage I very much do not care.

# How do I check what version of Psych it can run on?
Check the `readme.md` files as they'll talk about the content and what versions of the game it can run on.

Though sometimes the content will be split up into branches. For example, say the code is a hx file but to run in 0.6.3 I can't do that. There will be a seprate branch that has the contents in lua instead if possible.
