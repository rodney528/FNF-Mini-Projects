## How do I check what version of Psych it can run on?
Please check the `readme.md` files, as they will explain the content and what versions of the game it can run on.

Sometimes the content will be split up into branches. For example, say the code is a hx file but to run in 0.6.3 I can't do that. There will be a separate branch that has the contents in lua instead if possible.
